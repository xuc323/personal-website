# Personal Website

My name is Xu, and I also go by Albert. I am a senior at Lehigh University. I am pursuing my Computer Science Major here as well as a Data Science Minor. My CS experience hasn't started until high school. I have always been fascinated by how computers work and how they change our day-to-day life. Therefore I joined a summer camp during that time in which I learned my first programming language and could not wait to dive more into the fundamentals.

At this stage, I am looking for a position that can contribute to big projects. I look up to the applications that serve millions, and I admire those open-source projects that get used by millions of people.
